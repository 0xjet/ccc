## Questions

### Q1. CVE evolution 
The data feeds available at [CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com/) provide you with historical data and visualizations about CVEs. Youu can browse vulnerabilities by type, year, vendor, product/version, and CVSS score. Provide a longitudinal analysis of the evolution of the number and type of vulnerabilities over time. Discuss trends and identify how dif- ferent types of vulnerabilities have evolved, providing likely explanations for the observed figures.

### Q2. Ethical dilemmas
Discuss ethical positions for the following scenarios. Provide arguments in favor or against each position depending on your views. If the argument invoves an "it depends," elaborate on what circumstances make your position go one side or the other. These questions are complex and often there is no single right answer, but try to be as concise and clear in your answers as possible.

* __Ransomware__. Should victims pay or not to pay the ransom?
* __Legal malware__. You work for an AV / cyberthreat intelligence company and you come across an operation run by a law enforcement agency of your government that is affecting the society at large. Should you expose it or whitelist it?
* __Privacy disclosure__. You discover that a company implements an abusive data collection and dissemination policy. Should you: (i) conctact the vendor to express your concerns; (ii) disclose it publicly for everybody to know; or (iii) report it to your data protection agency?
