## Questions

### Q1. Just a question 
This [search engine](https://search.edwardsnowden.com) provides a useful categorization for the collection of Snowden docs. Explore a topic (e.g., Computer Network Operations, Internet content) or a codeword (e.g., XKEYSCORE) and write up a summary of the key findings along with a discussion on its implications.

### Q2. And another one
Write up two lists with the main key points in favor and against the use of backdoors in security systems so that law enforcement can access otherwise protected data.
