[TBD] This module of the course on [Cybercrime, Cyberespionage and Cyberconflicts](https://github.com/0xjet/ccc) examines the topic of why cyberspace is such a hostile environment. It provides a short introduction to the history of the Internet and its major themes. It then discusses types of threats and abuse (the _what_), opponents (the _who_) and their intent (the _why_). The module concludes with a debate on how we got here and why security is hard.

* Understand the history and development of the Internet and its security and privacy problems.
* Recognize different types of security incidents as classified by taxonomies used by CSIRTs.
* Know the different types of opponents and their intent, motivations, and means.
