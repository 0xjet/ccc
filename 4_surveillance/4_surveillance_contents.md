This module of the course on [Cybercrime, Cyberespionage and Cyberconflicts](https://github.com/0xjet/ccc) examines the topics of privacy and surveillance as practiced by governments and commercial firms. This is a huge area that connects with many other cyber and non-cyber issues. The purpose of this module is to provide a rather superficial historical overview of these topics and identify current debates and conflicting views.

**Learning Outcomes** 
* Understand how user tracking works in the web
* Know the main stakeholders in the commercial surveillance ecosystem
* Know the initiatives to backdoor cryptographic algorithms and systems, and discuss their pitfalls
* Identify and analyze the technical, legal, and ethical challenges relating to surveillance in cyberspace
* Discuss and analyze surveillance trends
