This module of the course on Cybercrime, Cyberespionage and Cyberconflicts examines the topics of privacy and surveillance as practiced by governments and commercial firms. This is a huge area that connects with many other cyber and non-cyber issues. The purpose of this module is to provide a historical overview of these topics and identify current debates and conflicting views.

**Learning Outcomes**

Learning Outcomes

Critically discuss and analyse the legal frameworks governing these activities
Critically assess the lawfulness of responses to these activities

This is an graduate course providing an introduction to some topics in the areas of cybercrime, cyberespionage and cyberconflicts. The material is used for the _"Cybercrime, Cyberespionage, and Cyberwar"_ course currently taught in the [Master in Cybersecurity](https://www.uc3m.es/master/cybersecurity) at [UC3M](https://www.uc3m.es/Home).

The course provides a gentle, not very technical introduction to various current security and privacy topics, including
* some bits of history,
* opponents and the current cyberthreat landscape,
* the underground economy of cybercrime,
* surveillance, including commercial surveillance, and
* the security of industrial control systems and IoT devices.

The main goal of the course is to provide students who approach cybersecurity with little-to-none previous backgound with a socio-techno-economic perspective of current security and privacy phenomena in the Internet, how we got here, and what might be done about it. The treatment of some topis might be too superficial for some audiences or might miss some key topics. The material can be extended with some extra effort to make up for these limitations.
