This module of the course on [Cybercrime, Cyberespionage and Cyberconflicts](https://github.com/0xjet/ccc) introduces the topic of cybercrime. It first provides an overview of the abuse ecosystem focusing on the main cybercrime activities (spamvertised products, ransomware, identity theft, carding and banking fraud). It then explores the supply chains that facilitate cybercrime and the commoditization of the key products (accounts, hosting, distribution, traffic, botnets, coding, crypters, etc.). The module concludes with some walkthroughs on representative marketplaces and forums.

**Learning Outcomes**
* Understand the commoditization of capabilities and services tailored to the cybercrime ecosystem.
* Know the different types of services available in the cybercriminal undergound.
* 
* 

Understand the history and development of the Internet and its security and privacy problems.
Recognize different types of security incidents as classified by taxonomies used by CSIRTs.
Know the different types of opponents and their intent, motivations, and means.
Discuss and analyze the technical, legal, and ethical challenges relating to security and privacy in cyberspace.
