This module of the course on [Cybercrime, Cyberespionage and Cyberconflicts](https://github.com/0xjet/ccc) examines the topic of why cyberspace is such a hostile environment. It provides a short introduction to the history of the Internet and its major themes. It then discusses types of threats and abuse (the _what_), opponents (the _who_) and their intent (the _why_). The module concludes with a debate on how we got here and why security is hard.
