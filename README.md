# Crime, Conflicts and Espionage in Cyberspace
[![CC BY-NC-SA 4.0][cc-by-nc-sa-shield]][cc-by-nc-sa]

This is a graduate course providing an introduction to some topics in the areas of crime, espionage and conflicts in cyberspace. The material is used for the _"Cybercrime, Cyberespionage, and Cyberwar"_ course currently taught in the [Master in Cybersecurity](https://www.uc3m.es/master/cybersecurity) at [UC3M](https://www.uc3m.es/Home).

The course provides a gentle, not very technical introduction to various current security and privacy topics, including
* some bits of history,
* opponents and the current cyberthreat landscape,
* the underground economy of cybercrime,
* vulnerabilities, exploits and their markets,
* surveillance, including commercial surveillance, and
* the security of industrial control systems and IoT devices.

The main goal of the course is to provide students who approach cybersecurity with little-to-none previous backgound with a socio-techno-economic perspective of current security and privacy phenomena in the Internet, how we got here, and what might be done about it. The treatment of some topis might be too superficial for some audiences and a few key topics are certainly missing, but this is a short (6 weeks) course and there is no room for more. The material can be extended with some extra effort to make up for these limitations.

For each topic, this repository contains a contents file providing:
* a description of the contents covered in the topic,
* a set of slides used in class during the lectures,
* a list of core readings,
* a list of questions, problems, and learning activities, and
* a list of supplementary readings for those who want to go a bit deeper into the subject.

## Labs

The labs are small practical projects meant to help students gain skills in a topic and reinforce knowledge discussed in class. Each lab consists of a practical task that require some independent study and experimentation with one or a few tools. They are used as part of the course assessment.
