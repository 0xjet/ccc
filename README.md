# Crime, Conflicts and Espionage in Cyberspace
[![CC BY-NC-SA 4.0][cc-by-nc-sa-shield]][cc-by-nc-sa]

This is a short graduate course providing an introduction to some topics in the areas of crime, espionage and conflicts in cyberspace. The material is used for the _"Cybercrime, Cyberespionage, and Cyberwar"_ course currently taught in the [Master in Cybersecurity](https://www.uc3m.es/master/cybersecurity) at [UC3M](https://www.uc3m.es/Home).

The course provides a gentle, not very technical introduction to various current security and privacy topics, including
* some bits of history,
* opponents and the current cyberthreat landscape,
* the underground economy of cybercrime,
* vulnerabilities, exploits and their markets,
* privacy and surveillance --including commercial surveillance--, and
* cyberwarfare.

The main goal of the course is to provide students who approach cybersecurity with little-to-none previous backgound with a socio-techno-economic perspective of current security and privacy phenomena in the Internet, how we got here, and what might be done about it. The treatment of some topis might be too superficial for some audiences and a few key topics are certainly missing, but this is a short (6 weeks) course and there is no room for more. The material can be extended with some extra effort to make up for these limitations.
