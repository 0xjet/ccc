This module of the course on [Cybercrime, Cyberespionage and Cyberconflicts]((https://github.com/0xjet/ccc) examines the topics of privacy and surveillance as practiced by governments and commercial firms.

The purpose of this module is to provide a rather superficial historical overview of these topics and identify current debates and conflicting views.

**Learning Outcomes**
* Dicuss the positions 
* Understand how user tracking works
* Identify and analyze the technical, legal, and ethical challenges relating to surveillance in cyberspace
* Discuss and analyze surveillance trends
