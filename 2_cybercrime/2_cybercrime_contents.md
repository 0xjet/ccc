This module of the course on [Cybercrime, Cyberespionage and Cyberconflicts](https://github.com/0xjet/ccc) introduces the topic of cybercrime. It first provides an overview of the abuse ecosystem focusing on the main cybercrime activities (spamvertised products, ransomware, identity theft, carding and banking fraud). It then explores the supply chains that facilitate cybercrime and the commoditization of the key products (accounts, hosting, distribution, traffic, botnets, coding and crypters, etc.). The module concludes with some walkthroughs on representative marketplaces and forums.

**Learning Outcomes**
* Know the different types of cybercrime activities.
* Understand the commoditization of capabilities and services tailored to the cybercrime ecosystem.
* Know the different types of services available in the cybercriminal undergound, the role they play in the supply chain, and their prices/pricing models.
